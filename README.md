## ðŸš€ About

Big-Whale is inspired by Dockerâ€™s whale logo, symbolizing the power of containers and the ambition to carry something huge.

As a university student, Iâ€™ve learned various tech stacks but often wondered:
- **How do I actually use them?**
- **Why are they important?**

This project documents my process of answering those questions by building practical solutions.
